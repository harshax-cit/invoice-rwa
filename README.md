# 🚀 invoice-chain  
### Decentralized MSME Invoice Financing Marketplace (RWA)

> **Transforming unpaid MSME invoices into liquid, trustless real-world assets**

---

## 📌 Problem Overview

Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are critical to economic growth, yet they suffer from a persistent **cash-flow crisis** caused by delayed invoice payments from large buyers.

### Core Challenges
- Invoice payments delayed by **60–120 days**
- Traditional financing options are:
  - Collateral-heavy
  - Slow and paperwork-intensive
  - Inaccessible to small MSMEs
- Investors lack **transparent and real-time risk visibility**
- MSMEs remain **credit-invisible despite steady revenue**

> Most MSMEs don’t fail due to lack of business — they fail due to **liquidity timing mismatch**.

### How It Works
- MSMEs tokenize unpaid invoices as **Invoice NFTs**
- Investors provide capital via **risk-segmented liquidity pools**
